Problem Breakdown:

    Each box is a node, and the keys inside a box are the edges to other nodes.
    Initially, box 0 is unlocked.
    Each box contains a list of keys, where each key corresponds to the number of another box.
    We need to check if all boxes can be opened using the keys available in the unlocked boxes.
